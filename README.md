## Usage
You can create geomtery from the Kinect's depth feed by simply:
```js
var kinectGeo = THREE.KinectronGeometry("mesh");
```
You can choose the rendering type by changing the first argument to ```"mesh" / "wire" / "points"```

And then simply add it your Three.js scene:
```js
scene.add(kinectGeo);
```

You would need to also bind the incoming Kinect image to the '''kinectGeo''' instance
```js
function onNewKinectFrame(ktronImg) {
	kinectronGeo.kinectron.bind(ktronImg.src);
}
```

For further reference use the [simple example](https://github.com/juniorxsound/Three-Kinectron/blob/master/examples/simple.html)

### Class methods:
- ```kinectGeo.setDisplacement(amount)``` - Increase or decrease the amount of displacement on the Z axis (Default value is 1.0).
- ```kinectGeo.setBrightness(amount)``` - Increase or decrease the brightness of the texture (Default value is 0.0).
- ```kinectGeo.setContrast(amount)``` - Increase or decrease the contrast of the texture (Default value is 1.0).
- ```kinectGeo.setOpacity(opacity)``` - Increase or decrease the opacity of the texture (Default value is 1.0).
- ```kinectGeo.setPointSize(opacity)``` - Increase or decrease the point size (Only when rendering points, "points").
- ```kinectGeo.setLineWidth(width)``` - Increase or decrease the line width (Only when rendering wireframe, "wire").
- ```kinectGeo.pause()``` - Pause the rendering of the Kinectron stream, keeps the last frame.
- ```kinectGeo.play()``` - Resume the rendering of the Kinectron stream.
- ```kinectGeo.bind(imageStream)``` - Bind a Kinectron image stream to the material, needs to be called everytime a new frame arrives.
- ```kinectGeo.update()``` - Calling the update method in the render loop will update the time uniform in the shader.







## Contribute
Fork/Clone the repository, make sure to use the ```--recursive``` flag when you clone to clone submodules too, and ```npm install``` all dependencies
### Build system commands:
- ```npm run start``` uses [concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently) to run both an [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) and a [watchify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/watchify) build opreation on every save to ```dist/kinectron.three.js```.
- ```npm run build``` builds a minified version of the plugin once and saves it to ```dist/kinectron.three.min.js```
